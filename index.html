<div>The first thing you HAVE to know before traversing this website is that Brice is a little bit of a prankster. You may find an allotment of easter eggs, seemingly out-of-place images, and memes scattered throughout the website!
<div>Just like this one!

<div>Friendly reminder that Brice is a bit of a prankster, so I would be cautions about hitting the "And much more!" link.
