<h1>Oh boy</h1>
<div>Well this is just great, everything on this page is in Wingdings.  I hope you're real proud of yourself Brice.
<div>I have no idea how to change this at the moment except by going back.
<div>I don't suppose you could understand Wingdings, but if you didn't feel like hitting the "back" button <a href="index.html">here's a link</a> to get back to the home page.
<div>At the bottom of this page, you will see a picture of Randy Marsh from South Park.  There are no apparent references to him in this webpage, and, I presume, is mostly to confuse you.
<div>Keep calm and carry on.
