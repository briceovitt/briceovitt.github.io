<h1>The Ghost of Brice's Future<img src="smolghost.jpg"></h1>
<div>As with most people today, the future for Brice is largely unknown.  He currently is an Undeclared major at the University of Maine, but he will be looking to switch into being a Business major.
<div>He has a job with UMaine Athletics running and sometimes recording statistics, and that field is also very interesting to Brice.  He is a man of math and statistics after all.
<div>All we really know is that he will keep on keeping on.  He hopes to continue doing the things he loves and being with the people he loves.  
<div>Continuing school at the University of Maine is a crucial step to accomplishing this goal.  While under constant pressure from friends and loved ones to transfer somewhere closer, he really enjoys the university and wants to stay more than most things he wants.
<div>Woah that's a bit sappy and deep.  Be sure that, while Brice is a man of jokes and happiness, he does have a sensitive side that comes out in deep moments.
